## Setting up your editor

**Note that this doc is incomplete and sometimes may require tinkering after
doing the actions here. We welcome additions, clarifications, and instructions
on how to set up other editors.**

If you're using VSCode, see instead [docs/vscode-setup.md](docs/vscode-setup.md).

### Merlin

Merlin is a language server used by ReScript that provides things like
autocompletion, type information, and go-to-definition functionality. Because
all libraries are installed inside the container and not on your local
machine, merlin needs to be running inside the container. Unfortunately, this
install is not completely isolated and we still need some supporting things
installed on your host machine.

_These instructions are quite possibly out of date, please let us know if this still works._

The way this works is that you'll need merlin on your host machine (to get the editor
support files) and then you'll point those at the `scripts/ocamlmerlin` wrapper
to execute the actual process inside the container. This means that you need
those scripts first in your `$PATH`.

- `export $PATH=[path to dark]/scripts:$PATH` in your shell config
- Install merlin:
  - `brew install opam`
  - `opam init -c 4.06.1`
    - grep `esy.json` for `"ocaml"` to ensure the version matches
    - copy snippet to your bashrc/shell config. DO NOT DO THIS FOR zsh. SEE BELOW.
  - `opam install merlin.3.2.2`
- Install editor integration:
  - vim+plug:
    - make sure you have a python provider for vim. Gvim comes with one. If you're using neovim, you can get one with `pip3 install pynvim`
    - add `Plug '~/.opam/default/share/merlin', { 'for': ['ocaml', 'merlin' ], 'rtp': 'vim' }` to your vim config file
  - others: ??

CAVEAT: If you install the zsh config that merlin recommends, it will
automatically execute the equivalent of `eval $(opam env)` after every command.
This command mucks with your `$PATH`, which means that you will never execute
the `scripts/` wrappers you want. Do not use the shell integration. Instead
call `eval $(opam env)` and then `export $PATH=[path to dark]/scripts:$PATH` (put
this in an alias or something).

### Formatting

You will also want to support formatting in your client. Dark uses Prettier for
JS/HTML/CSS, OCamlformat for ReScript, and Fantomas for F#. The script
`script/formatting/format` can be used to format or check formatting, and there is a
pre-commit hook you can use to run it automatically.

For emacs, see [the
readme](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#emacs-setup).

For vim:

- install [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
- Add to your `.vimrc` (with an appropriate path-to-dark replacement):

```
let g:ale_javascript_prettier_executable= '~/path to dark]/dark/scripts/formatting/prettier'
let g:ale_fixers =
\ {'rust': ['rustfmt'],
\  'javascript': ['prettier'],
\  'js': ['prettier'],
\  'html': ['prettier'],
\  'css': ['prettier'],
\  'scss': ['prettier']}
```

### Pre-commit hook

You probably also want to install a pre-commit hook that the formatters for
you.
`cp scripts/formatting/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`
